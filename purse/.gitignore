# Logs & Local Data
logs/*.log
# logs/ (ignore directory only if it's never versioned, e.g. if it always contains logs)
# For now, let's only ignore log files, not the directory itself, to allow an empty, versioned logs dir.
# If config.yml specifies local_user_data or similar, add it here.
# Based on config.yml structure in workplan:
user_data/
# local_user_data/ # (If this was a top-level dir)
# local_settings.yml # (If such a file is used for non-versioned local overrides)

# Search Index (Whoosh)
# The path in config.yml is 'user_data/search_index', and 'user_data/' is already ignored.
# If the index path was different or more specific patterns are needed:
# search_index/
# *.sqlite # If Whoosh uses SQLite directly and files are at root or unpredictable spots

# Test results if any specific format
*.test_results

# Secrets that might be accidentally added (though they should be in user-specific configs not versioned)
secrets.yml
*.secret

# Toga / Briefcase build artifacts (if any beyond standard Python dist/build)
